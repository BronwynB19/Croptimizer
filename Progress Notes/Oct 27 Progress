What I have
    I think all the math and calculations check out perfectly :)
    I'm really proud
What I need to do
    Finish formatting
    Add good comments
    Implement user input
    Have croptimize() also output total profit and leftover money
    Maybe add an 'if cant buy any crops: print because its past the last(largest) last_day"
    Update functions to have seasons in the parameters where the season = the respective crop_dict
    Clean actual code (LAST priority)
    Use matplotlib to make pretty data (for fun/practice)

Questions/Comments/Concerns
    Are there cases, e.g., croptimize(1000,15) = 12 Cauliflower and 2 Parsnip, where not buying the parsnips and
    using the saved money would be better to use the next day?
