What I did
    Implemented user input
    I changed all the direct SpringCropData calls to Crop_Data.SpringCropData
    Croptimize now outputs the unspent money from your budget
What I need to
    Finish formatting
    Add good comments
    Have croptimize() also output total profit
    Maybe add an 'if cant buy any crops: print because its past the last(largest) last_day"
    Update functions to have seasons in the parameters where the season = the respective crop_dict
    Clean actual code (LAST priority)
    Use matplotlib to make pretty data (for fun/practice)
    Account for profession/buff bonuses for price/etc. (much later)
    Update the functions to account for season (later)

Questions/Comments/Concerns
    Are there cases, e.g., croptimize(1000,15) = 12 Cauliflower and 2 Parsnip, where not buying the parsnips and
    using the saved money would be better to use the next day?
